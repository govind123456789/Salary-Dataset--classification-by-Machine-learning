# Salary-Dataset--classification-by-Machine-learning
The goal of the project is to develop and evaluation classifiers for a dataset.  Given a new person with some of the attributes from the table, I will be predicting whether that person will make more or less than 50k per year.  This dataset has a little more than 7,000 instances and has seven attributes.  Run this program by entering the following: `python classify.py > ../output/output_file_name`   - This will generate an output file with all of the classifier information in a file name     of your choosing.   - The visualization part of this project can be found in the graphs folder once the     program has run to completion.   - The "output_file_name" part of the program execution is not necessary.  It is there     because there is a matplotlib warning in the output that I can not find a solution     for.  Until I find a solution, the "prettiest" way to see the output is if you     direct the output to a file.
